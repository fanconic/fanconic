### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Claudio, and am a Master candidate at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (EEIT). I have a strong interest in data science, computer vision and machine learning.

Recently, I interned as machine learning engineer at IBM and as a management consultant / data scientist at McKinsey & Company.

As a small entrepreneurial side-project of mine, I prototyped a Java-based computer vision app for Android. The goal is to classify skin moles as benign or malignant. You can have a look at the source code here: https://github.com/fanconic/dermAI.
