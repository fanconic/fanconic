### Hi there 👋

I am Claudio, a PhD student in Machine Learning and AI in medicine at the University of Cambridge. Previously, I graduated from ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (EEIT). I have a strong interest in data science, computer vision and machine learning.

I interned as a research scientist at Sony AI, a machine learning engineer at IBM, and a management consultant/data scientist at McKinsey & Company.
